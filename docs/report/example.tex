\section{Introduction}

A section that has a sentence with a citation\cite{Dragland}. Blah blah blah...


\section{Problem characterization} %500 words

This is another section

\subsection{Transparency}
Here's a section that has an enumerated list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item "access transparency — hides the differences in data representation and procedure calling
mechanism to enable interworking between heterogeneous computer systems;
\item "location transparency — masks the use of physical addresses, including the distinction
between local versus remote;
\item "relocation transparency — hides the relocation of an object and its interfaces from other
objects and interfaces bound to it;
\item "migration transparency — masks the relocation of an object from that object and the
objects with which it interacts;
\item "persistence transparency — masks the deactivation and reactivation of an object;
\item "failure transparency — masks the failure and possible recovery of objects, to enhance fault
tolerance;
\item "replication transparency — maintains consistency of a group of replica objects with a
common interface; and
\item "transaction transparency — hides the coordination required to satisfy the transactional
properties of operations"\cite{ISO92}
\end{enumerate}

This list is not meant to be exhaustive of the requirements that may surface when designing a DFS, but should serve to cover the most frequently encountered ones.

\subsection{Naming of Distributed Files}
Here's some fixed-width text \texttt{//server1/dir/file}. Any client that wanted to access \texttt{//server/dir/file} need not be concerned with where that server is located (so long as they can access it). But now suppose that file hierarchy were to be migrated to another server, \texttt{//server2/dir/file}. Since the naming scheme does not support location independence, that is the path to file is absolute, the client can no longer access that file without knowledge of the new location.
